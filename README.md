 ## :beginner: About
 My Semester project is an auction website where unregistered users can view and search for listings. To add listings or make bids a profile must be created with a @stud.noroff.no account. Registered users can make bids, view a listings bidding history and find their own bids and listings, as well as their total credit on their profile. 
 
 You'll find the following pages:

- Index
- Listings page
- Listing details page
- New listing page
- Update listing page
- Profile page
